    Hi! I'm William, and this is my website.
    I'm currently in my third year of studying Mathematics and Computer
    Science at the University of Waterloo.  My past
    employers include #[a.link(href='http://www.bazaarvoice.com/') Bazaarvoice],
    where I was a JavaScript developer, and
    #[a.link(href='http://www.windriver.com/') Wind River], where I
    worked as a Python developer.
  p Non-technical hobbies/interests of mine include:
    ul
      li Cooking and baking
      li Reading
      li Hockey
      li Music
  p
    | As for the technical side of things, right now I'm
    | especially interested in learning about:
    ul
      li Machine learning
      li Embedded systems
      li Rendering / graphics
      li Audio / video encoding
      li Distributed systems

    Check out #[a.link(href='projects') my projects page]
    to see a little bit of fun I've been having with the canvas.
    Alternatively, you can see much more of my code
    #[a.link(href='https://github.com/WalrusCow') hosted on GitHub].

    Some other projects of mine which are either done or half-done include
    #[a(href='/projects/tetvas') a tetris clone],
    #[a(href='http://projecteuler.net/') Project Euler] (I've solved 54),
    #[a(href='https://github.com/WalrusCow/motionPlot') a motion chart library]
    for making simple charts in the canvas and, of course, this website.
    The source code for this site
    #[a(href='https://github.com/WalrusCow/website') is available on GitHub]
    for those who are curious.
